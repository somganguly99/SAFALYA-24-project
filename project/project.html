        <p>Civil Service is a dream for millions of people while growing up . But only the best of the best can make the cut. Some people arenâ€™t even able to clear prelims rounds during their lifetime . This maybe because of the few resources available for free , and the high cost of attending institutions for preparing for these exams . Our aim is to fix that with this project. Our website aims to provide free lecture videos , previous year papers and a one on one discussion between teacher and students during live classes . Our website is open for all allowing everyone to upload resource materials anytime anywhere . Once those materials pass our security checks , they are made public .</p>

            <p> Team Innovation Engine would like to thank Team SAMARTH for allowing us to build this project as a part of SAFALYA 2K24 . The team chose the topic "Remote Education for Civil Servants: Develop an online learning platform tailored for civil servants, providing them with relevant courses and training materials to enhance their skills and knowledge remotely". During the making of this project the team focussed mainly on the markup languages html and css to keep the website simple and accesible to all . The team utilized mordern technology such as making powerpoints to put forward the main concepts of the project in front of the judges . Thank You .</p>
